Final project for Tyler Mcginnis's React Course

Goal : Duplicate https://competent-tesla-bf9dde.netlify.com 

Completed built version! 

# Things I deviated from the original : 
- Added a score/karma for each post
- Used the brand name as /Top
- Hover/focus feedback

# Things I should have done differently ( in hindsight ) 
- Use CSS Component Modules -- I did not know that imported stylesheets can be used in other components
- Design components with modularity in mind -- I was able to refactor most duplicated functionality, but I could have saved that time if I did some planning before hand
- Fully construct the API before moving out with Routing & Front-End -- Jumping between modules has a warm-up time, it is much easier to fully complete a 'module' then on to the next section. Caveat : Working on another module helps me understand the requirements of the other as well.
- Be more wary of feature creep . The requirement was to duplicate the website, but throughout the development process I kept thinking of all the features I could add ( like nested comments, next page option, etc ) 

- Please build it with theming in mind. I used SASS and simply assumed I could just tack on theming after I'm done with everything else. Never been more wrong, even with React Context it was a major hurdle and had to tack on a lot of 'dirty' code.
