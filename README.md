### Refactored the code using React Hooks!

Everything looks much more concise and readable now. Didn't find a chance to implement the 'useReducer' hook so I'll have to look elsewhere. The useContext hook helped alot with wrapper hell though.

Also got rid of unused imports such as 'Link' from React-Router from various components.
